So Dan's just this guy, ya know?

Daniel Spisak was born from the fiery depths of fusion and now roams the pale
blue dot known as Earth. I obtained my bachelors degree in Computer Science from
UC Irvine at the end of 2007. I have been involved with and in technology &
security consulting firms,freelance tech writing,broadband ISPs and more. I used
to contribute to [Jerry Pournelle's website](https://www.jerrypournelle.com/chaosmanor/) and [Chaos Manor Reviews](http://chaosmanorreviews.com/). Additionally
I am also a freelance photographer as well and you can find my photos either on
my own personal gallery or up at my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/docwho76/) account.

This blog is the main location where I do my long form writing. I can also be
found on a variety of social networking and related sites. Just take a look at
the footer on any page to see other places I post content.
